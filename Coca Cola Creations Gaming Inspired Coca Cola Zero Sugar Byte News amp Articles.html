Now, the second Coca‑Cola Creations offering presents the first-ever Coca-Cola flavor born in the metaverse. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte will bring the flavor of pixels to life in a limited-edition beverage that transcends the digital and physical worlds. “For our second expression from Coca-Cola Creations, we wanted to create an innovative taste inspired by the playfulness of pixels, rooted in the experiences that gaming makes possible, said Oana Vlad, Senior Director, Global Strategy, The Coca-Cola Company. “Just as pixels power digital connection, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte brings people together to share moments of Real Magic.” A global, cross-functional Coca-Cola team led by the North America Operating Unit, featuring leaders across creative, marketing, technology, Ru0026D and design collaborated to determine the right elements to bring pixels alive in a taste experience. The drink’s bright, upfront taste is reminiscent of powering up a game, and its refreshing finish makes for a perfect gaming companion. Packaging graphics also feature pixels forming the iconic Coca-Cola logo. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte launched in extremely limited quantities in select countries in Latin America on April 4 in retail outlets. In the United States, on May 2, the product will be exclusively available to purchase in twin packs of 12.5-oz. slim cans online at www.coca-cola.com/creations, making the can itself a portal between the digital and physical worlds. China will follow with a retail launch on May 23. Similar to the Coca-Cola Starlight drop, which featured an Augmented Reality (AR) “Concert on a Can” starring pop star Ava Max, a suite of immersive digital experiences will introduce fans to Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte. The centerpiece is Pixel Point, an Island Created in Fortnite Creative designed by Coca-Cola and lifestyle and gaming organization PWR. Upon entry, players will discover Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte in the metaverse and interact with fellow gamers through a series of four sensory-inspired, multiplayer mini-games*: The Castle, The Escape, The Race and The Tower. Each immersive room poses its own challenge that can only be solved by working in tandem with fellow players to progress up the tower. "This new Coca-Cola Creations flavor is an amazing nod to gamers from one of the most iconic brands in existence, and we’re proud that we could help create something special for our shared communities to celebrate its launch,” said Lachlan Power, professional gamer and PWR founder. “It’s been an exciting project for PWR to collaborate on by creating this experience which facilitates teamwork and player connections whilst representing the vibe of this new Coca-Cola Creation.” Additionally, fans can scan a Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte package at www.coca-cola.com/creations to access an augmented reality (AR) game, which tells the story of BYTE, an 8-bit pixel left behind when Coca-Cola Byte entered the metaverse. Using fingers to hold down arrows, players can guide BYTE to “jump” up a spiral staircase so the lone pixel can rejoin the Coca-Cola logo. Players’ finish times will be posted to a virtual leaderboard that can be shared on social media. Coca-Cola, which has a longstanding connection to gaming, first entered the metaverse last year with its first-ever NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collectibles. On International Friendship Day 2021, four unique Coca-Cola NFTs were auctioned as a single “loot box” to raise funds for Special Olympics International. Most recently the brand announced a global partnership with Riot Games as a Founding Partner of League of Legends’ Wild Rift and Wild Rift esports. *The independently created Fortnite Creative experience is not sponsored, endorsed or administered by Epic Games Inc.",   "publisher": {"@context": "https://schema.org","@type": "Corporation","name": "The Coca-Cola Organization","url": "https://www.coca-colacompany.com","logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url":"https://www.coca-colacompany.com/images/coca-cola-company-logo.jpg"},"sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheCocaColaCo/","https://twitter.com/cocacolaco","https://www.instagram.com/thecocacolaco/","https://www.youtube.com/user/CocaColaCo","https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-coca-cola-company/"]} }]}

<p><b>From the Metaverse to IRL: Coca-Cola® Creations Opens Portal to Gaming-Inspired Coca-Cola®  Zero Sugar Byte</b></p>
<div>
<div class="aem-Grid aem-Grid--12 aem-Grid--default--12">
</div>
</div>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="/news/a-coca-cola-thats-out-of-this-world">Coca-Cola Starlight</a> offered fans a taste of outer space. Now, the second <a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/creations/thehub">Coca‑Cola Creations</a> offering presents the first-ever Coca-Cola flavor born in the metaverse. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte will bring the flavor of pixels to life in a limited-edition beverage that transcends the digital and physical worlds. </p>
<div>
<div class="aem-Grid aem-Grid--12 aem-Grid--default--12">
</div>
</div>
<p> “For our second expression from Coca-Cola Creations, we wanted to create an innovative taste inspired by the playfulness of pixels, rooted in the experiences that gaming makes possible, said Oana Vlad, Senior Director, Global Strategy, The Coca-Cola Company. “Just as pixels power digital connection, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte brings people together to share moments of Real Magic.”</p>
<div>
<div class="aem-Grid aem-Grid--12 aem-Grid--default--12">
</div>
</div>
<p>A global, cross-functional Coca-Cola team led by the North America Operating Unit, featuring leaders across creative, marketing, technology, R&amp;D and design collaborated to determine the right elements to bring pixels alive in a taste experience. The drink’s bright, upfront taste is reminiscent of powering up a game, and its refreshing finish makes for a perfect gaming companion. Packaging graphics also feature pixels forming the iconic Coca-Cola logo.</p>
<div>
<div class="aem-Grid aem-Grid--12 aem-Grid--default--12">
</div>
</div>
<p>Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte launched in extremely limited quantities in select countries in Latin America on April 4 in retail outlets. In the United States, on May 2, the product will be exclusively available to purchase in twin packs of 12.5-oz. slim cans online at <a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/creations/thehub" target="_blank">www.coca-cola.com/creations</a>, making the can itself a portal between the digital and physical worlds. China will follow with a retail launch on May 23.</p>

<p>Similar to the Coca-Cola Starlight drop, which featured an Augmented Reality (AR) “Concert on a Can” starring pop star Ava Max, a suite of immersive digital experiences will introduce fans to Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte. The centerpiece is Pixel Point, an Island Created in Fortnite Creative designed by Coca-Cola and lifestyle and gaming organization PWR. Upon entry, players will discover Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte in the metaverse and interact with fellow gamers through a series of four sensory-inspired, multiplayer mini-games*: The Castle, The Escape, The Race and The Tower. Each immersive room poses its own challenge that can only be solved by working in tandem with fellow players to progress up the tower. </p>

</div>
<p>Additionally, fans can scan a Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte package at <a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/creations/thehub" target="_blank">www.coca-cola.com/creations</a> to access an augmented reality (AR) game, which tells the story of BYTE, an 8-bit pixel left behind when Coca-Cola Byte entered the metaverse. Using fingers to hold down arrows, players can guide BYTE to “jump” up a spiral staircase so the lone pixel can rejoin the Coca-Cola logo. Players’ finish times will be posted to a virtual leaderboard that can be shared on social media. </p>

The prototype bottle comes more than a decade after the company’s PlantBottle™ debuted as the world’s first recyclable PET plastic bottle made with up to 30% plant-based material.\u0026nbsp;A limited run of approximately 900 of the prototype bottles have been produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have been working with technology partners for many years to develop the right technologies to create a bottle with 100% plant-based content—aiming for the lowest possible carbon footprint—and it’s exciting that we have reached a point where these technologies exist and can be scaled by participants in the value chain,” said Nancy Quan, Chief Technical and Innovation Officer, The\u0026nbsp;Coca\u0026amp;#x2011;Cola Company.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePET, the world’s most recycled plastic, comprises two molecules: approximately 30% monoethylene glycol (MEG) and 70% terephthalic acid (PTA). The original PlantBottle™, introduced in 2009, includes MEG from sugarcane, but the PTA has been from oil-based sources until now. PlantBottle™ packaging looks, functions and recycles like traditional PET but has a lighter footprint on the planet and its resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoca-Cola\u0027s new prototype plant-based bottle is made from plant-based paraxylene (bPX) - using a new process by Virent - which has been converted to plant-based terephthalic acid (bPTA). As the first beverage packaging material resulting from bPX produced at demonstration scale, this new technology signals a step-change in the commercial viability of the biomaterial. The bPX for this bottle was produced using sugar from corn, though the process lends itself to flexibility in feedstock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second breakthrough technology, which The Coca-Cola Company co-owns with Changchun Meihe Science \u0026amp; Technology, streamlines the bMEG production process and also allows for flexibility in feedstock, meaning more types of renewable materials can be used. Typically, bMEG is produced by converting sugarcane or corn into bioethanol as an intermediate, which is subsequently converted to bioethylene glycol. Now, sugar sources can directly produce MEG, resulting in a simpler process. UPM, the technology’s first licensee, is currently building a full-scale commercial facility in Germany to convert certified, sustainably sourced hardwood feedstock taken from sawmill and other wood industry side-streams to bMEG. This marks a significant milestone toward the commercialization of the technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The inherent challenge with going through bioethanol is that you are competing with fuel,” said Dana Breed, Global R\u0026amp;D Director, Packaging and Sustainability, The Coca-Cola Company.\u0026nbsp;“We needed a next-generation MEG solution that addressed this challenge, but also one that could use second generation feedstock like forestry waste or agricultural byproducts. Our goal for plant-based PET is to use surplus agricultural products to minimize carbon footprint, so the combination of technologies brought by the partners for commercialization is an ideal fit with this strategy.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, Coca-Cola unveiled its first prototype for a 100% bio-based PlantBottle™ at the Milan Expo using lab-scale production methods to produce bPX. This next-generation 100% plant-based bottle, however, has been made using new technologies to produce both biochemicals that make the bottle and are ready for commercial scaling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince introducing PlantBottle™, Coca-Cola has allowed non-competitive companies to use the technology and brand in their products—from Heinz Ketchup to the fabric interior in Ford Fusion hybrid cars. In 2018, the company\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"/content/journey/us/en/news/coca-cola-expands-access-to-plantbottle-ip.html\"\u003eopened up the PlantBottle™ IP more broadly\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;to competitors in the beverage industry to scale up demand and drive down pricing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of its World Without Waste vision, Coca-Cola is working to make all its packaging more sustainable, including maximizing use of recycled and renewable content while minimizing use of virgin, fossil material. The company has pledged to collect back the equivalent of every bottle it sells by 2030, so none of its packaging ends up as waste and old bottles are recycled into new ones; to make 100% of its packaging recyclable; and to ensure 50% of its packaging comes from recycled material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis innovation supports the World Without Waste vision, specifically the recently announced target to use 3 million tons less of virgin plastic from oil-based sources by 2025. The\u0026nbsp;Coca\u0026amp;#x2011;Cola Company\u0026nbsp;will pursue this 20% reduction by investing in new recycling technologies like enhanced recycling, packaging improvements such as light-weighting, alternative business models such as refillable, dispensed and fountain systems, as well as the development of new renewable materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Europe and Japan, Coca-Cola, with its bottling partners, aims to eliminate the use of oil-based virgin PET from plastic bottles altogether by 2030, using only recycled or renewable materials. While the majority of plastic packaging material will come from mechanically recycled content, some “virgin” material will still be needed to maintain quality standards. That’s why Coca-Cola is investing in and driving innovation to boost the supply of feedstock from renewable technologies as well as from enhanced recycling technologies. Enhanced recycling “upcycles” previously used PET plastics of any quality to high quality, food grade PET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are taking significant steps to reduce use of ‘virgin’, oil-based plastic, as we work toward a circular economy and in support of a shared ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” Quan said. “We see plant-based plastics as playing a critical role in our overall PET mix in the future, supporting our objectives to reduce our carbon footprint, reduce our reliance on ‘virgin’ fossil fuels and boost collection of PET in support of a circular economy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\n","tags":[]},"variationItems":[]},{"associatedPage":"/news/coca-cola-launches-real-magic-brand-platform-including-refreshed-visual-identity-and-global-campaign","contentFragment":"/content/dam/content-fragments/journey/us/en/news/coca-cola-launches-real-magic-brand-platform-including-refreshed-visual-identity-and-global-campaign","fragmentElements":{"articleTitle":"Coca-Cola Launches ‘Real Magic’ Brand Platform, Including Refreshed Visual Identity and Global Campaign","subTitle":"","publishedDate":"2021-09-29T15:00:00.000Z","author":"","heroImage":"/content/dam/journey/us/en/articles/desktop/coca-cola-real-magic-billboard.jpg","mobileHeroImage":"/content/dam/journey/us/en/articles/mobile/coca-cola-real-magic-billboard.jpg","thumbnailImage":"/content/dam/journey/us/en/articles/thumbnail/coca-cola-real-magic-billboard.jpg","altTextForImage":"","articleBody":"\u003cp\u003eCoca-Cola is inviting the world to celebrate the real magic of humanity in its first new global brand platform for the Coke Trademark in five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe “Real Magic” brand philosophy is rooted in the insight that magic lives in unexpected moments of connection that elevate the everyday into the extraordinary—a timeless learning that feels more relevant than ever in today’s hyperconnected yet divided world. Real magic happens when people get together and when what we share in common is greater than what sets us apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe “Real Magic” platform includes a new design identity for the Coke Trademark—which includes Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light/Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar—anchored by a fresh expression of the Coca-Cola logo. The “Hug” logo, inspired by iconic Coca-Cola packages wrapped with our signature trademark, was conceptualized by Wieden+Kennedy London. Coca-Cola engaged KnownUnknown, a global network of independent talent, to craft the visual identity, including all photography, animations and illustrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, a group of photographers, artists and illustrators will bring the “Real Magic” concept to life. Their different styles will provide a variety of campaign imagery, with some artists creating more realistic depictions and others offering more abstract variations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of “Real Magic”, Arroyo said, is to significantly increase the Coca-Cola consumer base through an ecosystem of experiences anchored in consumption occasions, such as meals and breaks, and merged with consumer passion points like music and gaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Real Magic’ is not just a tagline. We see it as a philosophy that transcends advertising and embodies all that is special about the brand,” Arroyo said, noting that it supports The Coca-Cola Company’s purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. “It will serve as our North Star by shaping all expressions of the Coca-Cola trademark in its next chapter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e‘One Coke Away From Each Other’\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe “One Coke Away From Each Other” campaign represents the first creative experience under the “Real Magic” platform. Blending real and virtual worlds, “One Coke Away From Each Other” is a metaphor that celebrates our common humanity. The film, which launched digitally on Sept. 27, asks what if Coca-Cola, as a symbol of togetherness, could bridge universes meant to be apart to create “Real Magic.” The film features three well-known gamers: DJ Alan Walker, Team Liquid’s Aerial Powers and Average Jonas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoca-Cola partnered with advertising agency BETC London to create the “One Coke Away From Each Other” campaign along with Colors Paris production company, as well as leading film director Daniel Wolfe and gaming and CGI specialist production partner Mathematic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe campaign also features social, digital and out-of-home executions. In select markets, Coca-Cola is running a code hunt beginning Oct. 11 where fans can win prizes, including gameplay sessions with celebrity gamers. There are 25 codes hidden within the film. Through collaboration with the Brand Partnership Studio at Twitch, the interactive livestreaming service, gaming creators on Twitch will unlock another 10 codes with viewers during livestreams on their Twitch channels.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a part of the campaign, Coca-Cola will award prizes to consumers who find and enter the hidden codes on a Coca-Cola micro site, in participating countries. Winners can receive their share of one of the largest-ever prize pools of Bits, a virtual good used to show support for Twitch streamers, as a part of the sweepstakes administered by Coca-Cola.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n","tags":[]},"variationItems":[]},{"associatedPage":"/news/project-last-mile-covid-19-vaccine-distribution","contentFragment":"/content/dam/content-fragments/journey/us/en/news/project-last-mile-covid-19-vaccine-distribution","fragmentElements":{"articleTitle":"Iteration, for Good: How Project Last Mile is Supporting COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution in Africa and Beyond","subTitle":"","publishedDate":"2021-09-20T12:00:00.000Z","author":"","heroImage":"/content/dam/journey/us/en/articles/desktop/iteration-for-good.jpg","mobileHeroImage":"/content/dam/journey/us/en/articles/mobile/iteration-for-good.jpg","thumbnailImage":"/content/dam/journey/us/en/articles/thumbnail/iteration-for-good.jpg","altTextForImage":"","articleBody":"\u003cp\u003eOver the last decade, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.projectlastmile.com/\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eProject Last Mile\u003c/a\u003e has leveraged the Coca-Cola system’s supply chain, logistics and marketing capabilities to expand access to HIV and malaria medicines across Africa. Now, the coalition of public-private partners—which includes The Coca-Cola Company, The Coca-Cola Foundation, PEPFAR, USAID, The Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—is working behind the scenes to help speed distribution and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines across the continent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly 2% of total vaccination doses administered globally have been in Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Most countries received their first vaccine shipments only weeks in late-February or early March, and in small quantities. To date, 1% of the continent’s population has been vaccinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help bridge this gap, The Coca-Cola Foundation recently awarded a $2 million grant to Project Last Mile—$1 million for South Africa and $1 million for additional countries across the continent—as part of the foundation’s $20 million “Stop the Spread” fund. An additional $500,000 grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation will support COVAX, a program co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines tests and treatments in the world’s poorest countries.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProject Last Mile and USAID work with South Africa’s National Department of Health (NDH) to design and operationalize a dispensing and distribution model for HIV antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. More than 3 million people get their ARVs from 3,000 pickup points across the country.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Beta variant of the coronavirus triggered a surge in infections in late-2020, the Coca-Cola system in South Africa engaged Project Last Mile to identify ways the Coca-Cola system could help government leverage private sector support to facilitate a mass vaccine rollout. Now, the Delta variant is sweeping across the continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Coca-Cola will not actually deliver the vaccines, teams will help connect government agencies with private sector and NGO partners and offer data and strategic, logistical and technical support on everything from transportation and warehousing, to supply chain and marketing. For example, Project Last Mile has shared GPS coordinates for retail pharmacies, private clinics and other potential vaccination locations and an audit of the Coke system’s dry ice capacity in 70 COVAX countries—including South Arican and Eswathini—for potential ultra-cold chain vaccine distribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crux of the current challenge remains availability. “We’re seeing tremendous willingness from the private sector across the continent, but there simply have not been enough vaccines at this stage to require a mass private sector intervention,” Ristow adds. “As soon as supply arrives, the government should be able to help get shots in arms quickly because the collective public and private sector teams have had time to prepare and plan. We see South African and Eswatini as test cases and, our learnings in these countries will help us continue to refine the Project Last Mile approach across the continent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProject Last Mile and Coca-Cola teams also are working to help develop and distribute COVID-19 awareness communications promoting preventative protocals like hand washing and social distancing, with a focus on HIV-positive communities who are especially vulnerable to life-threatening infections. Non-pharmaceutical interventions like these are vital to avoid surges especially as vaccine administration is slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLift and Shift\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProject Last Mile’s COVID-19 impact has extended beyond Africa. At the onset of the pandemic, Coca-Cola teams across Latin America connected with colleagues in Africa to explore how they could tailor the Project Last Mile framework and learnings based on country-specific vaccine distribution needs, as well as local capabilities and resources.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Colombia, Coca-Cola supported a government-led social media strategy to encourage citizens to get vaccinated and combat misinformation through educational videos, jingles, point-of-sale posters and influencer amplification. The President of Colombia publicly launched the campaign in March.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditional support in Latin America includes helping to fund shipment and delivery of the first cargo of vaccines arriving in Peru and donating 100 tablets to government-operated vaccination locations in the Dominican Republic. Coca-Cola also is partnering with the Red Cross to develop and support a $1 million regional vaccine awareness campaign supported by the “Stop the Spread” fund.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRistow said Project Last Mile continues to consult with Coca-Cola teams around the world, including in hard-hit markets like India.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As more Coca-Cola teams around the world come to understand our work, we are getting requests for insight on how to leverage our NGO and private sector partners to support COVID efforts,” he concluded. “We’re helping them think through how to create a model that makes it easier to partner with government at such a critical time by leveraging both the capabilities, resources and networks of the Coca-Cola system.”\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","tags":[]},"variationItems":[]}]}' data-style-url="https://shared.coke.com/content/dam/journey/components/content/contentFragmentCollection/articleTile/style.css" data-template-url="https://shared.coke.com/content/dam/journey/components/content/contentFragmentCollection/articleTile/template.hbs" id="TCCCWhatOthersAreReading">
