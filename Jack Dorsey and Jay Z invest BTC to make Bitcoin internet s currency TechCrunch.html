<div class="article-content">
<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey and rapper Jay Z have created an endowment to fund bitcoin development initially in Africa and India, Dorsey said on Friday.</p>
<p>The duo is <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1360114881978982403">putting 500 bitcoin</a>, which is currently worth $23.6 million, in the endowment called ₿trust. The fund will be set up as a blind irrevocable trust, Dorsey said, adding that the duo won’t be giving any direction to the team.</p>
<p>₿trust is looking to hire three board members. The mission of the fund is to “make bitcoin the internet’s currency,” a job application describes.</p>
<p>Government in India has so far been reluctant to embrace bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Friday’s move comes as New Delhi is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">inching closer to introducing a law that would ban private cryptocurrencies</a> in the nation. It is also looking to create its own digital currency.</p>
<p>“Even though India is the software development capital of the world, we haven’t contributed to bitcoin core development in any significant way,” explained Varun Deshpande, co-founder of <a href="https://onjuno.com/">OnJuno</a>, which is building a digital banking platform from India for Asian Americans, to TechCrunch.</p>

<p>“India always had the skills to contribute but lacked the right incentives. Today’s initiative is even more significant since it provides the right incentives for developers from the world’s largest democracy to contribute and have a say in bitcoin’s protocol development and bring in a diversity of thoughts in shaping the future of money. The irony is as India prepares a bill to ban bitcoin in India, the world is turning to our massive technical talent in India to secure and safeguard the bitcoin network.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Africa, most especially Nigeria, on the other hand, has experienced a surge in cryptocurrency transactions in recent years. Last year, Nigerians traded more than <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/01/06/nigerians-traded-more-than-400m-worth-crypto-2020/">$400 million worth of cryptocurrency</a> on major local crypto exchanges, and the country is <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1947769/nigeria-is-the-second-largest-bitcoin-market-after-the-us/">only second to the U.S.</a> in terms of volume of bitcoin traded in the last five years.</p>
<p>Africans that trade cryptocurrencies rely on them because they offer protection against currency devaluation and for value exchange during cross-border transactions. In Nigeria, bitcoin trading became ubiquitous last year <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/10/25/africa/nigeria-end-sars-protests-analysis-intl/index.html">during the #EndSARS protests</a> that rocked the country. When donations for the protests began to flow from all parts of the country and in the diaspora, the Nigerian government shut down the bank accounts used for this effort. But bitcoin became a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nigerian-activists-bitcoin-endsars-police-brutality">lifeline</a> keeping the crowdfunding activities alive.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been growing concerns that the Nigerian government had intentions to regulate cryptocurrency in the country. Last week, those doubts were actualized as the country’s apex bank gave a <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/africa/1970446/nigerias-central-bank-takes-aim-at-cryptocurrency-again/amp/">directive</a> to banks and financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrency or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchange platforms.</p>
<p>Dorsey has long supported the adoption of cryptocurrency. Square <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-buying-and-selling-to-all-users/">already supports bitcoin</a> and last year <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment">acquired about $50 million worth of bitcoin</a> for its corporate treasury, and Twitter is studying the potential use of bitcoin to pay its employees and vendors.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1359501275650547714?s=20">CNBC earlier this week</a>, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said, “We’ve done a lot of the upfront thinking to consider how we might pay employees should they ask to be paid in bitcoin, how we might pay a vendor if they ask to be [paid] in bitcoin and whether we need to have bitcoin on our balance sheet should that happen. It’s something we continue to study and look at, we want to be thoughtful about over time, but we haven’t made any changes yet.”</p>
<p>Many high-profile industry executives have called for nations to embrace bitcoin. Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor and entrepreneur who previously served as the chief technology officer of Coinbase, earlier this month made a case for <a href="https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/">why India should embrace bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>“India has the talent to pull this off. Such a move would make international headlines, attract global support from the world’s technologists and financiers, differentiate India from the increasingly zero-sum economic policies pushed by America and China, and put the country at the forefront of a trillion dollar industry,” he wrote, envisioning the potential unblocking bitcoin would create for India.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story said Kenya was planning to use bitcoin as a reserve currency. That is not accurate and the error is deeply regretted. </em></p>

He had initially tried to communicate with the security team at the Mumbai-based airline directly but did not find a direct contact.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI reached out to the airline via their official Twitter account, asking them for an email ID to report the issue. They gave me the info@akasa email ID to which I didn\u2019t share the vulnerability details because it might be handled by support staff or third party vendors. So, I emailed them again and asked [the airline] to provide [the] email address of someone from their security team. I received no further communication from Akasa,\u201d the researcher said.<\/p>\n<p>After not getting a response from the airline on how he can connect with the security team, the researcher informed TechCrunch about the issue.<\/p>\n<p>Akasa Air quickly responded when we reached out and acknowledged that the issue had put 34,533 unique customer records at risk. The airline also said the exposed data did not include travel-related information or payment records.<\/p>\n<p>On being made aware of the incident, Akasa Air shut down its sign-up service. The airline also said that it added additional controls before resuming its service to the general public.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the airline told TechCrunch that it carried additional reviews to ensure the security of all its systems.<\/p>\n<p>Akasa Air reported the incident to India&#8217;s nodal cybersecurity agency CERT-In and notified its affected users through a statement that it also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.akasaair.com\/update-06121983\">made public<\/a> on Sunday. It advised users &#8220;to be conscious of possible phishing attempts&#8221; due to the data exposure. Further, it confirmed to TechCrunch that it did not see an \u201cuntoward spike in access\u201d to the data.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At Akasa Air, system security and protection of customer information is paramount, and our focus is to always provide a secure and reliable customer experience. While extensive protocols are in place to prevent incidents of such nature, we have undertaken additional measures to ensure that the security of all our systems is even further enhanced. We will continue to maintain our robust security protocols, engaging wherever applicable, with partners, researchers, and security experts from whom we can benefit to strengthen our systems,&#8221; Anand Srinivasan, Co-Founder and Chief Information Officer at Akasa Air, said in a prepared statement on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am glad the airline fixed the issue on short notice and reported it to CERT-In as well as informed its customers about the incident, which is an exemplary step,&#8221; the researcher said.<\/p>\n<p>Incidents of data exposure and leaks are becoming common in India, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/03\/india-government-to-withdraw-personal-data-protection-bill\/\">withdrew the last iteration of its data protection bill<\/a> earlier this month.

Collectivism is in vogue. And this week brought a whole slew of examples to prove that exact point.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with Stanford. Three years ago, a group of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/27\/stanford-students-are-short-circuiting-vc-firms-by-investing-in-their-peers\/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=WPunit\">Stanford students began working with Fenwick &amp; West law firm<\/a> to find a legal structure that met their needs: no accreditation requirement or hard limit on the number of people involved. The effort eventually turned into Stanford 2020, an investment club that raised $1.5 million for its debut fund. Fast-forward to today, the leader of that club, Steph Mui, is trying to replicate that playbook in the form of a venture-backed startup. PIN, which stands for &#8220;power in numbers,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/25\/stanford-investment-pin-seed-5-6-million\/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=WPunit\">recently raised a $5.6 million seed funding round<\/a> led by Initialized Capital, with investments from GSR, NEA, Industry and Canaan.<\/p>\n<p>Mui credited the growing mindshare around crypto-native DAOs as part of the reason that investment clubs are of more interest these days. \u201cWe started before DAOs became really cool,\u201d Mui said. \u201cWhen we started, the kind of DAO-like structure that we set up around voting was more of a necessity from a regulatory standpoint \u2026 now it\u2019s actually a huge bonus.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To go from helping Stanford students invest in their peers to trying to help anyone with a community do the same is a big bet on the future of investment. As Mui addressed, when Stanford 2020 first launched, some reacted that it was an unsurprising move for a privileged set of folks to participate in a privileged asset class. It almost stopped the startup from existing entirely.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWhat changed that divide for me was talking to literally over 100 groups \u2026 and realizing that\u2019s totally not the case,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m a founder, I realize that all startups have very different needs \u2026 all those groups benefit from having community clubs of all different sorts on their cap table because of the expertise they require.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While interest is certainly cemented, hurdles exist both when it comes to getting diverse beta users (and making sure that startups want a club\u2019s money in the first place).<\/p>\n<p>For my full take \u2014 and for this headline to actually make sense \u2014 read my latest TechCrunch+ piece, written alongside my work bestie Anita Ramaswamy: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/27\/community-group-dao-investing-clubs-wall-street-bets-collective-social-startups\/\">\u201cInvestment clubs are cool again, and maybe community is, too.\u201d<\/a> And, to thank you for being a Startups Weekly subscriber, here\u2019s a little TC+ discount for you: Enter \u201cSTARTUPS\u201d at check-out for 15% off of your subscription.<\/p>\n<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll get into Sequoia\u2019s newest wave of bets, a layoff update and as always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nmasc_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">following me on Twitter<\/a><strong>. <\/strong>I appreciate you!<\/p>\n<h2>Sequoia\u2019s surge<\/h2>\n<p>Despite the regional slowdown, Sequoia Capital India and Southeast Asia have announced their <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/22\/sequoia-surge-7-cohort-15-early-stage-indian-southeast-asian-startups\/\">accelerator\u2019s latest cohort of companies<\/a>.

(That is, mDAUs are mostly people, not spambots.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These millions of non-mDAU accounts are part of the median user\u2019s experience on the platform,&#8221; states the complaint. &#8220;And for this vast set of non-mDAU active accounts, Musk is correct: Twitter executives have little or no personal incentive to accurately &#8216;detect&#8217; or measure the prevalence of spam bots,&#8221; it reads.<\/p>\n<p>The complaint then goes on to say that Twitter, when asked in 2021, couldn&#8217;t identify the total number of spam bots on its platform, and couldn&#8217;t provide an accurate upper bound on that figure.<\/p>\n<p><em>Ah ha!,<\/em> right? <em>Even Twitter doesn&#8217;t know how much spam it has!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Well, maybe that&#8217;s not the smoking gun you might think.<\/p>\n<p>Musk&#8217;s legal argument is that Twitter has been misleading its users and investors about the number of bots on its platform, which the company has estimated to be less than 5%. (Because surely this all hasn&#8217;t come about because Musk overpaid for the deal and now wants out!)<\/p>\n<p>However, Twitter has been reporting to the SEC that spam and bots are less than 5% of its <em>mDAUs<\/em> &#8212; a figure that&#8217;s essentially already scrubbed of bots so advertisers know how many real eyeballs they&#8217;re able to reach. What&#8217;s more, while Zatko may have a point that this sort of made-up, proprietary metric is ripe for manipulation, he also says in the complaint that Twitter execs are <em>&#8220;incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAUs.&#8221;<\/em> In other words, it seems likely that Twitter&#8217;s statements to the SEC <em>are<\/em> correct when Twitter says its mDAU figures are &#8220;less than 5%&#8221; spam.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, even if Twitter doesn&#8217;t know how much total spam is on the platform at any given time, that doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t figure out how much spam is in its <em>mDAU<\/em> figure &#8212; a figure Twitter has explained it calculates using private data. Twitter looks at things like IP addresses, phone numbers, geolocation, client\/browser signatures and more,<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paraga\/status\/1526237587085463553\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> CEO Parag Agrawal noted in a Twitter thread<\/a>. This helps it to come up with its mDAU figure, by classifying accounts that appear to belong to &#8220;real&#8221; users as such.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now, we know we aren\u2019t perfect at catching spam. And so this is why, after all the spam removal I talked about above, we know some still slips through. We measure this internally. And every quarter, we have estimated that &lt;5% of reported mDAU for the quarter are spam accounts.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Parag Agrawal (@paraga) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paraga\/status\/1526237585441296385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 16, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting the total spam on Twitter&#8217;s platform is always in flux &#8212; when Twitter does a big sweep for spam and bots, users have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/07\/12\/628522147\/twitter-is-removing-millions-of-fake-followers-from-users-lists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noticed their follower counts drop<\/a>. However, Twitter wasn&#8217;t monetizing based on those bots nor was it reporting inflated user metrics to the SEC by including spambots in its user figures &#8212; at least, not since <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/business\/twitter-is-slowly-perfecting-the-art-of-inventing-nonsensical-performance-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its invention of the mDAU in 2019<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And while it&#8217;s true that mDAUs are not a representation of the spam-filled Twitter user experience today &#8212; an experience, remember, that Musk claimed he was buying Twitter to fix! &#8212; they are an indicator of how many real people are on the site. And that&#8217;s what a new owner would want to know anyway, right?<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not mDAUs represent Twitter<em> as it truly is<\/em> misses the point. Sure, mDAUs may be a non-standard metric. It might not be comparable to the metrics used by other social platforms. It may even be a bad metric! But that&#8217;s not relevant to the case. The fact is, it&#8217;s not a new metric. Twitter defined it years ago and was using mDAUs long before Musk committed to buying Twitter. It&#8217;s what Twitter reports to the SEC.<\/p>\n<p>So good luck using this as proof of being lied to, Mr. Musk. Can&#8217;t wait to see how that works in court!<\/p>\n<h3>In other news, Twitter expands into podcasting<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2379242\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2379242\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2379242 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg 1796w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/twitter-podcasts.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2379242\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While the whistleblower news may have been the biggest news story of the week, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2022\/listen-up-podcasts-are-coming-twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropped<\/a> some pretty significant product news as well. It&#8217;s turning itself into a podcast app.<\/p>\n<p>The company announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/25\/twitter-is-officially-adding-podcasts-to-its-platform\/\">an update to its Twitter Spaces tab<\/a> that would see it integrating podcasts into a revamped experience where content is now organized into hubs called &#8220;Stations.&#8221; These Stations group content by topics &#8212; like news, sports, music and more. The app will also make recommendations based on who you follow and how you engage with content. Twitter Spaces &#8212; including both live and prerecorded audio &#8212; will also continue to be available in the Spaces tab.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch had previously reported that<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/03\/twitter-to-revamp-spaces-tests-themed-stations-and-a-daily-digest\/\"> Twitter was developing<\/a> Stations and a personalized audio digest as part of a makeover coming to its Spaces tab, but we didn&#8217;t know the extent of the podcast integrations at the time. The company tells us it&#8217;s making over 2 million podcasts available at launch, which are programmatically recommended to users.<\/p>\n<p>Podcasts are ingested as RSS feeds, which means the 2 million figure is not a hard limit &#8212; Twitter could expand. Still, it&#8217;s a notable out-of-the-gate start, as Spotify today has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/08\/spotify-hypes-the-revenue-potential-of-podcasts-and-audiobooks-at-its-second-investor-day-event\/\">more than 4 million podcasts<\/a>, many of which are produced in-house, exclusives or shows recorded in its Anchor app.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter, of course, is home to its own sort of exclusives, known as Twitter Spaces. These live audio programs can be recorded for later listening &#8212; similar to podcasts. If the creator doesn&#8217;t download, edit and package the Space to send it out to other services on a podcast RSS feed, then these Spaces remain something you could <em>only<\/em> find on Twitter. (Of note, Twitter says it would include both the recorded Twitter Space and the resulting podcast of that Space in its app &#8212; allowing it to count the same show twice.)<\/p>\n<p>Twitter will make recommendations of podcasts to individuals based on how they listen and engage with people and <a href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/follow-and-unfollow-topics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">topics.<\/a> This could also be a competitive advantage of sorts.<\/p>\n<p>As to why it felt the need to do podcasts? That&#8217;s less clear. Twitter told us it wants to be &#8220;the home for audio conversations.&#8221; It also sees an overlap between podcast listeners and Twitter users. Based on its own internal research, 45% of U.S. Twitter users listen to podcasts monthly. More realistically, it likely sees the ability to monetize audio with ads &#8212; if this effort pays off.<\/p>\n<p>However, Twitter falls short in terms of key features that would make its app an alternative to your favorite podcast player. There&#8217;s no offline listening, no download capability, no support for paid podcasts and no exclusive partnerships. So who, exactly, does the podcast feature serve &#8212; those so addicted to Twitter they can&#8217;t even leave the app to stream a favorite program, we suppose.<\/p>\n<h1>Weekly News<\/h1>\n<h3>Platforms: Apple<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-2379386 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-2.30.45-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/news\/?id=o5cryh1p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> its iPhone event<\/strong> will take place on September 7 at 10 AM PT.

Here&#8217;s what Zuckerberg thinks about various things.<\/p>\n<p>(These quotes have been very lightly edited for clarity.)<\/p>\n<h2>Zuckerberg on symmetry<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>Part of what&#8217;s a little trippy about it is that in some ways, some of these experiences, I think, feel more realistic than for example having a Zoom call, right, where you can actually see the person&#8217;s face. Because I mean, the way that our memory works, it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s very special. Right? So, you know, when I when I leave here today, I&#8217;ll remember that you were across from me, and there&#8217;s a symmetry, right, it&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re across from me. So that means I&#8217;m across from you. We have a shared memory of kind of the space, of the place.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it doesn&#8217;t quite work because the headphones but normally, you know, if I, if you talk it&#8217;s coming from that direction, and spatial audio and kind of directional building a spatial model of things is how we make memories. So you take something like Zoom, and it just completely blows it up. Because now it&#8217;s every meeting that you have looks the same, right? There&#8217;s no symmetry, right? So if you&#8217;re in the top left of my, of my box, square, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m in the same place for you. So we actually we don&#8217;t have any kind of shared spatial sense of that.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While I appreciate Zuckerberg&#8217;s attempt at an aesthetic (in its broader sense) argument regarding the sympathetic nature of forming shared memories, I feel that the interactions he&#8217;s describing are actually highly <em>asymmetric<\/em> in real life, and Zoom in fact creates a sort of super-symmetry contained in the flat display that doesn&#8217;t reflect the differences we would feel. If you and I are in the same room, what we see and hear from each other is really quite different and we may remember it very differently.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true that a shared VR environment would create more of a sense of space common to both participants, but I question whether that environment would be more conducive to memory than a video call. Certainly the environments available in Meta&#8217;s VR platforms are incredibly generic.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2313873\" style=\"width: 790px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2313873\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2313873\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/meta-venues-horizon.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/meta-venues-horizon.png 780w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/meta-venues-horizon.png?resize=150,63 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/meta-venues-horizon.png?resize=300,125 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/meta-venues-horizon.png?resize=768,320 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/meta-venues-horizon.png?resize=680,283 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/meta-venues-horizon.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2313873\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Meta<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/RIuPTKaR_xI\">Seems familiar&#8230;<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Zuckerberg on improving art<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>So in a world, in the future, where you know, a lot of the things that might be physical today, I mean, maybe these, this kind of art and sculptures and stuff that you have here. Maybe in the future, they&#8217;re not physical, maybe they&#8217;re just holograms, because you can change them really easily. Maybe over time, the sort of ratio of the amount of physical stuff that we interact with to digital stuff shifts and becomes more balanced, or something like that.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas if historically, it was all physical and there was very little kind of information or digital overlay on top of it&#8230; I think it&#8217;s probably gonna be a lot healthier for us. Rather than consuming kind of all this additional context through this tiny little portal that we carry around on a phone, and you&#8217;re just kind of like looking at this and you&#8217;re missing the whole context. I think to have it be able to be overlaid and you know, have have kind of people be able to pop in and interact with them through it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s telling that Zuckerberg thinks that the problem with art today is there&#8217;s not enough virtual context being overlaid directly on it, and holographic docents who offer you a guided virtual tour of the piece. Now, certainly anything that gets people to engage with art more is probably good, but you have to wonder whether the solution really is an augmented reality headset issued to you when you walk into the Louvre. Why physically go there, or anywhere, at all? I guess his entire company is an attempt to answer that question.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kqCeXjVHmj\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/19\/mark-i-sure-hope-it-isnt\/\">Mark Zuckerberg says the metaverse won&#8217;t be as cringey as his cursed selfie<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Mark Zuckerberg says the metaverse won&#8217;t be as cringey as his cursed selfie&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/19\/mark-i-sure-hope-it-isnt\/embed\/#?secret=L223Wp2bIv#?secret=kqCeXjVHmj\" data-secret=\"kqCeXjVHmj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Zuckerberg on the evolution of social media<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>The Holy Grail is building something that can create a sense of human presence. Right? It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve spent the last almost 20 years of my life building social software, you know, making it so that whatever limited computation you have, you can kind of share something about your experience. And it started off with primarily text, right, when I was in college, then we all got these smartphones and had cameras so that it became a lot of photos. Now the mobile networks are good enough that it&#8217;s starting to be a lot more video. And to me, this kind of like immersive experience is clearly going to be the next step.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The progression from text to image to video does certainly suggest that something more &#8220;immersive&#8221; would be the next step, but this fails to consider the fact that all three of these formats work perfectly fine with a phone type device and the only difference between them is essentially bitrate. It&#8217;s a <em>quantitative<\/em> progression, and Zuckerberg is proposing that we are on the verge of a fundamental <em>qualitative<\/em> change, one that disposes of everything people already value about the text, images, and videos they engage with (as people have engaged with them for millennia) and substitutes an expensive, invasive, and very unfamiliar new method. I don&#8217;t think it follows.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xVOV1QwIse\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/17\/a-new-tiktok-feature-lets-creators-share-tiktok-stories-to-facebook-and-instagram\/\">A new TikTok feature lets creators share TikTok Stories to Facebook and Instagram<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A new TikTok feature lets creators share TikTok Stories to Facebook and Instagram&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/17\/a-new-tiktok-feature-lets-creators-share-tiktok-stories-to-facebook-and-instagram\/embed\/#?secret=zl8fU6uI46#?secret=xVOV1QwIse\" data-secret=\"xVOV1QwIse\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Zuckerberg on waking up<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>You wake up in the morning. Look at my phone to get like a million messages&#8230; It&#8217;s usually not good, right? I mean like, people reserve the good stuff to tell me in person, right? But it&#8217;s like, okay, what&#8217;s going on in the world that I need to kind of pay attention to that day, so it&#8217;s almost like, every day you wake up and you&#8217;re like, punched in the stomach and that&#8217;s like, okay, well, fuck.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I saw this quote singled out by someone earlier so it caught my eye. It&#8217;s relatable of course, even though most of us don&#8217;t run a company weathering PR crisis after PR crisis. What I wonder is, how does he wake up every morning feeling like he&#8217;s been punched, A) when he&#8217;s rich and can do literally anything, but B) when he runs a company that touches so many people and provides so much opportunity to improve that somehow. Year after year Facebook and other social platforms have magnified and generated controversy and extremism. You wake up every day and see the fruits of that, and your response is to reset yourself, not the system you created.<\/p>\n<p>To be fair that may be what he&#8217;s thinking about while he &#8220;resets&#8221; by going &#8220;surfing or foiling&#8221; on his family ranch on <span class=\"js-about-item-abstr\">Kaua\u02bbi<\/span>. Around here foiling means smoking crack, but he probably means the sport.<\/p>\n<h2>Zuckerberg on angry platforms<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>One of the decisions that we&#8217;ve basically made is if someone makes if someone kind of gives an angry reaction, we actually don&#8217;t even count that in terms of whether to show it to someone else.<\/p>\n<p>When I was making that decision internally, a bunch of teams were like, well, you know, there is a lot that&#8217;s wrong in the world, and people should be angry about that and stuff like that. That&#8217;s probably&#8230; that&#8217;s fair. But I&#8217;m not here to design a service that makes people angry.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Facebook has both promoted and profited from outrage and anger at a scale pretty much unprecedented in the history of the world. I feel like the horse has left the barn here and Zuckerberg is out here carefully oiling the pins on the lock.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ANpcLCo1Tg\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/05\/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate\/\">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/05\/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate\/embed\/#?secret=NjHXbKygjp#?secret=ANpcLCo1Tg\" data-secret=\"ANpcLCo1Tg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Zuckerberg on debugging the brain<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>And then you can use AI techniques over time to be able to kind of extrapolate from what you&#8217;ve seen in very high resolution of the tissue that you&#8217;ve removed from the body to now being able to okay even though there&#8217;s like optical and physical limits of what you can see with a microscope in a body you can use all this data that&#8217;s been generated in AI to effectively be able to see different cells interacting, like no one has ever seen a synapse, you know, neuron, like fire, like, like what it looks like in the the synapse of a brain before, like in a living organism.<\/p>\n<p>But I kind of think my engineering, my perspective on this is like, how are you going to debug a system or help solve it if you can&#8217;t like step through the code, right, like one line at a time and like, see everything that&#8217;s happening. If you want to really understand what&#8217;s going on in the brain, you need to see that, right?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This type of perspective is one of many valid but sort of non-overlapping magisteria when it comes to the question of how to understand the brain. Obviously psychologists and behavioralists focus on higher-level phenomena and don&#8217;t really care how many neurons of whatever type are involved. Others see action potentials and immediately interpret it as code, since they are essentially binary (though they ultimately form an analog system). That Zuckerberg would espouse this point of view was a foregone conclusion.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that the brain&#8217;s operations are a form of code and must be rendered intelligible in order to be &#8220;debugged&#8221; isn&#8217;t necessarily harmful, though it is (like most mental models) kind of fundamentally reductive. But it has the potential for harm if, like so many do in tech, people prematurely assert that they have the system figured out. Some of the worst treatments and aborted intellectual approaches to intelligence, consciousness, and perception came from people with a little information and a big agenda.<\/p>\n<h2>Zuckerberg on his face<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>I mean&#8230; Obviously the Senate testimony is not exactly an environment that is set up to accentuate the humanity of the subject.

Friday\u2019s move comes as New Delhi is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/30\/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies\/\">inching closer to introducing a law that would ban private cryptocurrencies<\/a> in the nation.

The irony is as India prepares a bill to ban bitcoin in India, the world is turning to our massive technical talent in India to secure\u00a0and safeguard the bitcoin network.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Africa, most especially Nigeria, on the other hand, has experienced a surge in cryptocurrency transactions in recent years. Last year, Nigerians traded more than <a href=\"https:\/\/techpoint.africa\/2021\/01\/06\/nigerians-traded-more-than-400m-worth-crypto-2020\/\">$400 million worth of cryptocurrency<\/a> on major local crypto exchanges, and the country is <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/africa\/1947769\/nigeria-is-the-second-largest-bitcoin-market-after-the-us\/\">only second to the U.S.<\/a> in terms of volume of bitcoin traded in the last five years.<\/p>\n<p>Africans that trade cryptocurrencies rely on them because they offer protection against currency devaluation and for value exchange during cross-border transactions. In Nigeria, bitcoin trading became ubiquitous last year <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/amp.cnn.com\/cnn\/2020\/10\/25\/africa\/nigeria-end-sars-protests-analysis-intl\/index.html\">during the #EndSARS protests<\/a> that rocked the country. When donations for the protests began to flow from all parts of the country and in the diaspora, the Nigerian government shut down the bank accounts used for this effort. But bitcoin became a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/nigerian-activists-bitcoin-endsars-police-brutality\">lifeline<\/a> keeping the crowdfunding activities alive.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, there have been growing concerns that the Nigerian government had intentions to regulate cryptocurrency in the country. Last week, those doubts were actualized as the country&#8217;s apex bank gave a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/qz.com\/africa\/1970446\/nigerias-central-bank-takes-aim-at-cryptocurrency-again\/amp\/\">directive<\/a> to banks and financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrency or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchange platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Dorsey has long supported the adoption of cryptocurrency. Square <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/31\/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-buying-and-selling-to-all-users\/\">already supports bitcoin<\/a>\u00a0and last year <a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/us\/en\/press\/2020-bitcoin-investment\">acquired about $50 million worth of bitcoin<\/a> for its corporate treasury, and Twitter is studying the potential use of bitcoin to pay its employees and vendors.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SquawkCNBC\/status\/1359501275650547714?s=20\">CNBC earlier this week<\/a>, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said, \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of the upfront thinking to consider how we might pay employees should they ask to be paid in bitcoin, how we might pay a vendor if they ask to be [paid] in bitcoin and whether we need to have bitcoin on our balance sheet should that happen. It\u2019s something we continue to study and look at, we want to be thoughtful about over time, but we haven\u2019t made any changes yet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many high-profile industry executives have called for nations to embrace bitcoin. Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor and entrepreneur who previously served as the chief technology officer of Coinbase, earlier this month made a case for <a href=\"https:\/\/balajis.com\/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin\/\">why India should embrace bitcoin<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIndia has the talent to pull this off. Such a move would make international headlines, attract global support from the world&#8217;s technologists and financiers, differentiate India from the increasingly zero-sum economic policies pushed by America and China, and put the country at the forefront of a trillion dollar industry,\u201d he wrote, envisioning the potential unblocking bitcoin would create for India.<\/p>\n<p><em>An earlier version of this story said Kenya was planning to use bitcoin as a reserve currency.
